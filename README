This repo only version controls the source code.

## YouTube Demo: Pending

Limitless is a currently in-progress Third Person ARPG prototype developed by Brandon Lam. 
Links to assets used are credited at the bottom of the README. 
The goal of this project is primarily for learning to recreate features heavily inspired by FromSoftware, creator of the Dark Souls franchise. 
This repository contains images of the features I've currently implemented and the source code that I've written so far. 
A full video will be available on YouTube as the prototype nears completion and I decide to move on to another project to continue learning.

# Player Controls
Navigate the world using the WASD keys.
Players can jump by using the spacebar.
The left mouse button to perform a vertical strike.
The right mouse button can be used to perform a horizontal strike.
Pressing E lets the player pick up items in the world, including their sword.
With a weapon equipped, players can press the Z key to sheathe and unsheathe a currently equipped weapon.

# Animations:
Animations are primarily developed on the Blueprints side, making use of animation blueprints to play a wide variety of animations.
At the moment, there are animations for the player attacking, moving, jumping and for when they are standing on non-level surfaces by using inverse kinematics.
Inverse kinematics animations were determined by using virtual bones and sphere traces to determine how to properly place the actual legs of the main character.
Some animations came from the Valley of the Ancients project and belong to the Echo player character
Other animations were imported from Mixamo and set to be used by the Echo character via animation retargeting.

# Combat:
Combat mechanics are currently unfinished, but at the moment the player is able to attack enemies with their sword.
By using a box collider and box trace, we are able to detect when enemies are hit, and by using vector math we are able to calculate the direction from which enemies are hit to play the according animation. Enemies currently are able to be hit from the front, back, left and right sides.

Features to be implemented involving combat include enemy AI behavior, and stats including health, stamina and more interesting damage calculations including weapon stats and enemy armor values.

# Destructibles:
Currently the world has a few different types of destructibles that the player can hit with their weapon, causing them to break.
This was accomplished using Unreal Engine's chaos physics and geometry collections.
